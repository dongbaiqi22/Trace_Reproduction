## TRACE Reproduction (+ My Idea)

This repository reproduces **TRACE** for multi-trial neuroscience time-series data.

- Paper (arXiv): https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04906

### My addition
On top of the original TRACE setup, I add an additional positive-pair construction baseline:
- **Spatial neighbors**: treat neurons/cells that are close in physical space as positive pairs.
